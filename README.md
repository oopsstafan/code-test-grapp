## Getting Started

Be sure you have your MySQL client side and server side both ready to go and then start this app.

Please run 'npm run start' in root path to start the react application


## Introduction
This is a small web application created by React.js on frontend and node.js on backend. Users can create member or reward, assign or unassign a reward to a member, search member information, or delete member or reward.


## Assumptions
1. When you start the application, I initialized a member 'kevin' and a reward 'gold'. Member info includes member id(pk), member name, and reward id(fk); Reward info includes reward id(pk) and reward name.
2. A member can only be assigned one reward
3. Validations include new member or reward name can not be existed, when searching, deleting members or rewards, they must be existed
4. All inputs are case sensitive.
